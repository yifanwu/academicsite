    <div id="bio"><p>I am a first year PhD student at UC berkeley working in data systems, advised by <a href="http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/jmh/">Prof. Joe Hellerstein</a>. I received my A.B. in Computer Science from Harvard College in 2014. <a href="assets/yifanwu_cv.pdf">Curriculum Vitae</a>.</p></div>
    <div id="more"><p>I'm working with Joe and <a
    href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~ewu/">Eugene</a> on interactive visualization systems,
    exploring data-centric programming models related to <a href='http://bloom-lang.net/'>Bloom</a>
    and SQL. </p>
    <p>Recently, we investigated consistency in the interactive visualization context, and how a declarative
    visual interaction language grounded in the relational model could help deal with the problem.
    The <a href="assets/devil.pdf">paper is here</a>, and I will be giving a short talk at <a href="http://hilda.io/2016/">HILDA</a> Jun 2016
    and another at <a href="http://www.thestrangeloop.com/">Strange Loop</a> Sept 2016. </p>

    <p>We are currently working on making the language real, and thinking of ways to make it
    not only deal with consistency issues but also execute fast and easy to program ---
    we hope to have the prototype working summer 2016; stay tuned! Another project we are exploring
    is automatically generating interative visualizations based on past SQL queries. We have modeled this as a cool multi-objective graph problem. WIP, stay tuned.
